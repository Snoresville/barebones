-- Installation --
The original path of these files is:
scripts/vscripts/components/abilities/heroes/hero_phoenix/

If the path to these files has to be changed, then you must also change the paths to lua files in abilities in npc_abilites_custom.txt

In the original npc_abilites_custom.txt:
#base ../vscripts/components/abilities/heroes/hero_phoenix/npc_abilities_custom.txt

In the original npc_heroes_custom.txt:
#base ../vscripts/components/abilities/heroes/hero_phoenix/npc_heroes_custom.txt

Change the base file path depending on where you place the files

-- Dummy Unit --
Phoenix script uses dummy units, so put the dummy unit definition in npc_units_custom.txt

-- Fire Spirit Particle --
Because the original particle for fire spirits is fucked, I have to steal the working version from Dota IMBA
It has already been referenced in the code for the location of said particle, which is provided in the folder.
If you change the destination, you will need to reference the particle file again in phoenix_fire_spirits_pf.lua

-- English Text --
Copy the text from addon_english.txt to the one in the resource folder. 
I dunno how to grab it through the #base implementation, so you'll have to make changes that way.
